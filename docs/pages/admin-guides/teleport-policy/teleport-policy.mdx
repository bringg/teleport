description: A reference for Access Graph with Identity Security.
---

Teleport Identity Security unifies management of access policies across your infrastructure.
It hardens your access controls and visually shows up-to-date relationships and policies of all users, groups, and computing resources
It can help you answer questions like:

- What resources can a specific user access?
- What users can access a specific resource?
- What are the relationships between users, roles, and resources?

## Getting started with Identity Security

Identity Security is a separately licensed product and is available to Teleport Enterprise customers.
Access Graph is a major capability of Identity Security that visually shows the relationships of
policies of users, groups, and computing resources.

To verify the availability of the Access Graph, ensure that the Policy icon is present in the navigation sidebar.

<Admonition type="note">
Note: For managed Enterprise customers, Identity Security is enabled by default.
If you are a self-hosted Teleport customer, you will need to [deploy the Access Graph Service](../deploy-a-cluster/access-graph/access-graph.mdx) and ensure you have an updated
`license.pem` with Identity Security enabled to use it.

## Identity Activity Center

Teleport Identity Activity Center is a centralized data platform that enhances visibility,
search, and analysis of activity from both human and non-human across multiple data sources.

It provides a rich visualization layer that maps real-time access policies
across commonly used platforms such as AWS, GitHub, Okta, and Teleport with the real-time
activity from those identities.

Built to support security and operations teams, Identity Activity Center extends
correlation of identity-based events across platforms. During investigations and incident
response, it surfaces contextual insights powered by an intelligent alerting engine
that detects anomalies from audit logs and highlights unusual behavior and the associated
access levels each identity has across organization services.
