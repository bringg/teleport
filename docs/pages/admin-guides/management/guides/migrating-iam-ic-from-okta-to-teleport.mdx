title: Migrating AWS Identity Center from Okta to Teleport
description: A guide for gradually migrating an Identity Center instance from Okta control to Teleport control
tocDepth: 3
---

## Overview

The goal of this guide is to alow you to transition from Okta managing
Identity Center users and groups to Teleport management, including having
Teleport control individual user and group Account Assignments.

By default, Teleport controls all user and group provisioning into 
Identity Center, which is fine for a new deployment, but can cause issues in an
existing deployment. In this guide we will describe how to transition control
from Okta to Teleport in a staged fashion, so that you can move across
incrementally as you gain confidence with Teleport's Identity Center integration.

## Prerequisites

 - A working Teleport cluster
 - An AWS role configured as per the [Identity Center guide](./aws-iam-identity-center.mdx)
   for the integration to use
 - AWS credentials configured for the Teleport auth process to pick up and use 
   (e.g. as environment vars, system profiles, etc)
 - An Okta API token, with the following privileges:
   - View users and their details
   - View groups and their details
   - View applications and their details
 - The AWS Identity Center ARN, AWS region, SCIM base address and SCIM bearer token

## Migration Path

### Starting Point

This is our starting configuration: Okta as sole Identity Source for Identity Center

![Migration Starting Point](../../../../img/identity-center/ic-migrate-start.png)

### Midway

This is the point where you can start migrating control of users and groups from
Okta to Teleport. At this stage:

 - Okta provides SSO login for Identity Center
 - Okta manages a subset of the Identity Center group membership (selected via Push Groups)
 - Okta and Teleport both control user provisioning via SCIM
 - Teleport manages a second subset of Identity Center groups (selected via group filters during plugin installation)
 - Teleport controls IC Group Account Assignments for the Identity Center groups under its control
 - Teleport controls direct IC User Account Assignments for the Identity Center users under its control

![Migration Mid Point](../../../../img/identity-center/ic-migrate-mid.png)

### Ending point

Once Teleport is in control of all the users and groups you want to provision
into Identity Center, the Okta Provisioning and Push Groups functions can be
retired, leaving Okta only providing SSO login.

![Migration End Point](../../../../img/identity-center/ic-migrate-end.png)

## Step 1: Install Okta SAML connector

Install Okta SAML connector into Teleport as per the Teleport 
[Okta as an SSO provider](../../access-controls/sso/okta.mdx) guide.

<Admonition type="note">
 Ideally, both Identity Center and Teleport will use the same Okta SAML application
 for their signin, which guarantees that both Okta and Teleport will view the same 
 user set. 

 If this is not possible, the most flexible approach we've found is having an
 an Okta Group for those users that should have IC access, and then assigning
 both the Okta Identity Center App and the Okta SAML App used for Teleport SAML
 connector to that group. This ensures that the same user set is visible across
 both applications.
</Admonition>

You will need the Teleport SAML Connector Name and Okta SAML App ID in the next
step.

## Step 2: Install the Teleport Okta integration

We will be using a very limited subset of the Teleport Okta integration in this 
deployment, disabling all features except periodic user synchronization. This
configuration is not supported by the normal installation UI, so we will have to
use `tctl` to install it:

```console
$ ./tctl plugins install okta \
    --org ${OKTA_ORG_URL} \
    --saml-connector ${TELEPORT_SAML_CONNECTOR_NAME} \
    --app-id ${OKTA_SAML_APP_ID} \
    --api-token ${OKTA_API_TOKEN} \
    --no-scim \
    --no-accesslist-sync \
    --no-appgroup-sync
```

This will install the Okta integration and start the User sync service. You can
monitor the state of the Okta integration in the Teleport Integrations UI.

## Step 3: Wait for user sync

To make sure everything is working, wait until the first Okta to Teleport user
sync has occurred. You can verify this by either
 - refreshing the user page and finding your Okta users,
 - checking the Okta integration status page, or

Once your Okta users are imported into Teleport, you can progress to the next
step.

## Step 4: Install the Teleport Identity Center Integration.

Again, we need to install the plugin using `tctl`. 

```console
$ ./tctl plugins install awsic \
    --arn ${IDENTITY_CENTER_INSTANCE_ARN} \
    --region ${IDENTITY_CENTER_INSTANCE_REGION} \
    --use-system-credentials \
    --url ${IDENTITY_CENTER_SCIM_BASE_URL} \
    --token ${IDENTITY_CENTER_SCIM_BEARER_TOKEN} \
    --default-owner ${TELEPORT_ACCESS_LIST_DEFAULT_OWNER} \
    --user-origin okta \
    --account-name ${ACCOUNT_NAME_ALLOW_FILTER} \
    --group-name ${GROUP_NAME_ALLOW_FILTER}
```

During the installation process, Teleport will import all of the Identity Center 
groups that match its allow list (or all of them, if no allow list is defined)
and create matching Access Lists, preserving the group membership and account
assignments.

<Admonition type="warning">
Individual User Account Assignments will _not_ be preserved during import. You
will need to ensure these are preserved manually, or converted to group assignments
prior to installation.
</Admonition>

### Group import control

The Group import allow-list is controlled by the `--group-name` option. You can
specify multiple filters and a Group will be imported if matches _any_ of the
supplied filters. Filters can be either literal names, globbed names or Go
compatible regular expressions. To treat a filter as a regular expression, 
enclose it in a leading `^` and trailing `$`.

Example filters:
 - `administrators`: The literal "administrators" group
 - `site-*`: Any group with the prefix `site-`
 - `^(?:[^a]|a[^w]|aw[^s]|aws[^\-]).*$`: Any group that does _not_ have the prefix `aws-`


<Admonition type="note">
Ensure that there is no overlap between the groups imported to Teleport and the
groups you want Okta to maintain control over.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
Avoid creating an Access List with the same name as a Push Group managed by Okta.
Teleport will attempt to adopt the group, and may change the group membership.
Deleting the Teleport Access List and forcing a re-push from Okta should restore 
access.
</Admonition>

### User provisioning control

Your Teleport cluster may have a mix of local Teleport users (e.g. a local Admin
user) and users imported from Okta. By default, Teleport will try to provision
_all_ Teleport users into Identity Center. You can control which users are 
provisioned by the Identity Center integration with the `--user-origin` and 
`--user-filter` arguments. In the example above, the `--user-origin okta` will 
restrict Teleport to only provisioning users that are synced from Okta, and 
excluding all local Teleport users.

### AWS Account import control

By default, Teleport will take control of Account Assignments for all AWS Accounts
managed by Identity Center. You can create an allow-list of AWS Accounts to
import with the  `--account-name` and `--account-id` install options. 

The `--account-name` filters work like the `--group-name` filters above. The 
`--account-id` filters specify a literal AWS Account ID.

Teleport will not create or delete Account Assignments on AWS accounts outside
of its allow-list.

## Step 5: Migrate Account Assignments

We're now at the midway point, and ready to migrate Account Assignments from the
Okta-managed groups into new Teleport-managed Access Lists. To migrate groups,
create a new Access List in Teleport (taking care not to use the same name as
the existing Okta-managed Group) and create the appropriate memberships and 
Account Assignments.

Account Assignments can be created on an Access List by assigning it the Account
Assignment roles created by the Identity Center integration, assigning it a 
custom Teleport role that specifies a specific combination of access, or a
combination of each.

For more information, see the [Identity Center Integration guide](./aws-iam-identity-center.mdx)

## Step 6: Retire Okta group provisioning

Once you are happy that a group has been migrated to Teleport control, you can
remove the corresponding push Group from the Okta Identity Center integration.

Depending on the version of Okta, you _may_ have to manually delete the Identity
Center Group using the AWS console.
